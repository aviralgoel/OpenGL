# Learning OpenGL
![Alt Text](https://i.imgur.com/I1t5KfL.gif)
I followed The Cherno's OpenGL tutorial series on YouTube to learn OpenGL for C++. This repository has code which taught me about
- Basics of OpenGL
- Vertex buffer, Index Buffer, Buffer layouts and Vertex Arrays
- Writing Shaders (vertext and fragment)
- Debugging OpenGL
- Abstracting textures, buffers, shaders into classes
- Math and Model-View-Projection in OpenGL
- ImGui
- Batch Rendering in OpenGL

## Outcome
Towards the end of the tutorial series, I had a good idea about graphics programming in general. While I have a lot to practice. I could render Quads on screen taking advantage of batch rendering.
